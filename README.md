# 👋 Hi there! I'm Hazem Ali

🎓 Computer & Systems Engineering student at **Ain Shams University**

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a developer and engineer who thrives at the intersection of **hardware and software**.  
I love solving problems from the ground up — whether it’s writing efficient C code for a microcontroller, building algorithms in C++, or working directly with ARM and MIPS Assembly.

I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and contributing to projects that challenge my understanding of how computers really work.
